ABSTRACT


The goal was to create a website for Mood Measurement online. Keeping the track of your mood Daily/monthly/yearly anywhere anytime according to your will. It will not only help you to track your mood, it will also help you to compare your mood with the previous days/months/years so that you can improve accordingly. People nowadays are so busy in their lifestyle that they tend to forget about their mental health. Mental health is as important as physical heath which most of us underestimates it. A person can simply login, go to the calendar section, select the emoji according to their mood and put it in the current date. It is very user-friendly, straightforward and uncomplicated user interface for our users.

We are looking forward to add few more services and services for our users for more enhanced mood-tracking such as bar graph and pie chart in the future.

This was done in order to get better understanding of the skills that are needed in the area of website design and development. There were many things that were taken in order to submit a successful project such as Behavioural Research, identifying audiences.
